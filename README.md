A quick coding assignment!

MinSum.java, PairCounter.java and Stack.java can be run directly without any inputs, since the example inputs are hardcoded into them. Further changes can be made within the code at their respective variable declarations.

I have also included a command-line driven version for MinSum and PairCounter (named with the -cmd added to the end). Their input format are as follows :

java MinSum-cmd.java <number of array elements> <element1> <element2> .... <element n>
e.g. java MinSum-cmd.java 3 1 2 2  
  
java PairCounter-cmd.java <number of array elements> <element1> <element2> .... <element n> <k difference>
e.g. java PairCounter-cmd.java 6 1 1 2 2 3 3 1

I have NOT included a command line driven version for the Stack operations file, since that requires an interactive menu to use, and I was not sure if you were looking to evaluate that, as I see no use for it in production. That being said, I can include it if necessary.
